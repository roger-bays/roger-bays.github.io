## Roger Bays website redirect

This repository is a simple redirect link to my website.

It serves two purposes:

1. Provides a simpler, shorter, and better URL than the Google Sites URL (where the site is hosted).

2. Overcomes a known issue with Google Sites URLs, where users may incorrectly get sent to the Google login page, rather than the intended Google Sites webpage.

### Website (this redirect)

[https://roger-bays.github.io](https://roger-bays.github.io)

### Website (where hosted)

Please use the link above to avoid the issue mentioned:
https://sites.google.com/view/Roger-Bays
